## History

### Latest
First attempt at new node.js version.

### Original
This was written as a ASP.NET app back in the mid-2000s. Dave hosted it on an old Dell server at his house. When it finally died some 11 years later, he decided to update it and build a
node.js version with a basic EJS front-end.
